## Linear Regression

For this lab, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!
```{r}
abalone <-read_csv("C:/Users/lisha/Downloads/abalone.csv")
```

### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.
```{r}
##library(dplyr)
abalone <-abalone %>%
  mutate(age=rings+1.5)
abalone
```

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.
```{r}
abalone %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=age))+geom_histogram()
```

The distribution of age is a little bit right skewed. Most of the abalone are between 5 and 17 years old. 

### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*
```{r}
abalone <- abalone %>% select(-rings)
set.seed(403)
data_split <-initial_split(abalone,prop=0.8,strate=age) # stratified sampling based on age, 80% to be the training data
data_train <-training(data_split)
data_test <-testing(data_split)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include `rings` to predict `age`. Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors
2.  create interactions between
    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`
3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.
```{r}
simple_data_recipe <-
  recipe(age~.,data=data_train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())%>% # convert categorical data to numerical data
  step_interact(terms= ~ starts_with("type"):shucked_weight+longest_shell:diameter+shucked_weight:shell_weight) %>% # for categorical value, use starts_with()
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) # help center and scale data
```

We should not use rings to predict age because these two variables are essentially the same. There is really no need to predict age if we already know the rings of abalone. We are, however, interested in the relationship between rings and other predictors.

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.
```{r}
lm_model <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")
```

### Question 5

Now:

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model you created in Question 4, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.
```{r}
lm_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lm_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(simple_data_recipe)
```

### Question 6

Use your `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.
```{r}
lm_fit <- fit(lm_wflow, data_train)
new_data <- tibble(longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1,type="F")
data_train_result <- predict(lm_fit,new_data)
data_train_result 
```

### Question 7

Now you want to assess your model's performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **training data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R^2^* value.
```{r}
data_metrics <- metric_set(rmse,rsq,mae)
data_train_all_result <- predict (lm_fit,new_data=data_train%>%select(-age))
final_predict <-bind_cols(data_train_all_result,data_train %>% select(age)) 
final_predict
data_metrics(final_predict,truth=age,estimate = .pred)
```

The Root Mean Square Error is 2.138, the coefficient of determination is 0.5567 and the mean absolute error is 1.5438. In terms of coefficient of determination, 0.5567 means that 55.67% of variability observed in the target variable is explained by the regression model. Since this value is not very large compared to 1, this indicates that the regression model does not perform very well in predicting the target variable.

### Required for 231 Students

In lecture, we presented the general bias-variance tradeoff, which takes the form:

$$
E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2]=Var(\hat{f}(x_0))+[Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2+Var(\epsilon)
$$

where the underlying model $Y=f(X)+\epsilon$ satisfies the following:

- $\epsilon$ is a zero-mean random noise term and $X$ is non-random (all randomness in $Y$ comes from $\epsilon$);
- $(x_0, y_0)$ represents a test observation, independent of the training set, drawn from the same model;
- $\hat{f}(.)$ is the estimate of $f$ obtained from the training set.

#### Question 8

Which term(s) in the bias-variance tradeoff above represent the reproducible error? Which term(s) represent the irreducible error?

$$Var(\hat{f}(x_0))$$ and $$[Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2$$ are the reducible errors, whereas $$Var(\epsilon)$$ is the irreducible error.

#### Question 9

Using the bias-variance tradeoff above, demonstrate that the expected test error is always at least as large as the irreducible error.

The reason why expected test error is always at least as large as the irreducible error is because even if we minimize the reducible errors to 0, we still leave with irreducible error ($$Var(\epsilon)$$) in the bias-variance tradeoff, meaning that expect test error should always be greater than or equal to irreducible error.

#### Question 10

Prove the bias-variance tradeoff.

Hints:

- use the definition of $Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))=E[\hat{f}(x_0)]-f(x_0)$;
- reorganize terms in the expected test error by adding and subtracting $E[\hat{f}(x_0)]$
